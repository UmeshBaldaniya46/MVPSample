# android-mvp-architecture
A sample project of Android MVP architecture.

## Libraries
In this sample project includes some of useful libraries for Android, such as:
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe REST client for Android which intelligently maps an API into a client interface using annotations.
- [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/): Using Java annotations, makes Android development better by simplifying common tasks.
- [Eventbus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus): Event bus for Android and Java that simplifies communication between Activities, Fragments, Threads, Services, etc. Less code, better quality
- [Lonstraint Layout]: A beautiful, allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).

Before we go through to learn this architecture, I hope you've understand about the **Clean Architecture**
- **Independent of Frameworks.**
- **Testable**.
- **Independent of UI.**
- **Independent of any external agency.**
